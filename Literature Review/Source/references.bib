    abstract = "{Radiation hybrid (RH) map construction allows investigators to locate both type I and type II markers on a given genome map. The process is composed of two steps. The first consists of determining the pattern distribution of a set of markers within the different cell lines of an RH panel. This is mainly done by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) amplification and gel electrophoresis, and results in a series of numbers indicating the presence or the absence of each marker in each cell line. The second step consists of a comparison of these numbers, using various algorithms, to group and then order markers. Because different algorithms may provide (slightly) different orders, we have compared the merits of the MultiMap and TSP/CONCORDE packages using a data set of information currently under analysis for construction of the canine genome RH map.}",

    abstract = { We use a branch-and-cut search to solve the Whizzkids'96 vehicle routing problem, demonstrating that the winning solution in the 1996 competition is in fact optimal. Our algorithmic framework combines the LP-based traveling salesman code of Applegate, Bixby, Chvátal, and Cook, with specialized cutting planes and a distributed search algorithm, permitting the use of a computing network located across Rice, Princeton, AT\&T, and Bonn. The 1996 problem instance wasdeveloped by E. Aartsand J. K. Lenstra, and the competition was sponsored by the information technology firm CMG and the newspaper De Telegraaf. }

abstract = "The Traveling Salesman Problem (TSP) is a very hard optimization problem in the field of operations research. It has been shown to be NP-complete, and is an often-used benchmark for new optimization techniques. One of the main challenges with this problem is that standard, non-AI heuristic approaches such as the Lin–Kernighan algorithm (LK) and the chained LK variant are currently very effective and in wide use for the common fully connected, Euclidean variant that is considered here. This paper presents an algorithm that uses adaptive resonance theory (ART) in combination with a variation of the Lin–Kernighan local optimization algorithm to solve very large instances of the TSP. The primary advantage of this algorithm over traditional LK and chained-LK approaches is the increased scalability and parallelism allowed by the divide-and-conquer clustering paradigm. Tours obtained by the algorithm are lower quality, but scaling is much better and there is a high potential for increasing performance using parallel hardware."
